# Image Processing and Filters: Basic Manipulations and Transformations

This repository contains simple implementations for image processing, including fundamental operations commonly used in computer vision. It allows for manipulating, transforming, and filtering images using OpenCV and Matplotlib.

## 🔹 Features:

### ✅ Basic Manipulations:
- **Pixel Modification**: Change specific pixel values.
- **Row Modification**: Alter an entire row of pixels.
- **Inversion**: Reverse colors or pixel intensities.

### ✅ Geometric Transformations:
- **Cropping**: Select a specific region of an image.
- **Resizing**: Adjust image size using different interpolation methods.
- **Flipping**: Horizontal and vertical mirroring.
- **Rotation**: Rotate an image by a specific angle.

### ✅ Image Filters:
- **Gaussian Filter**: Smooths the image to reduce noise.
- **Laplacian Filter**: Enhances edges and contours.
- **Low-Pass Filter**: Blurs the image by removing high-frequency details.
- **High-Pass Filter**: Extracts fine details and sharp edges.
